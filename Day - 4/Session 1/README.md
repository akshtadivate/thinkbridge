## Day 1

Updated my VS Code with new version and also login to my existing Github profile.
Read and understand the resource link and practice.
In which HTML and CSS study present.

In the session, I explored the VS Code interface in detail. I tried out the Command Palette and learned how Settings Sync can help keep my environment consistent across different machines.  

I installed a few must-have extensions: Prettier for formatting, Live Server for quick previews, and ESLint for catching mistakes in JavaScript. After installing them, I dug into their features to understand when and why they should be used.  

To finish, I made Prettier my default formatter and enabled auto-format on save so my code stays clean without extra effort.
