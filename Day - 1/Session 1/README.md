### Terminal Basics Learned
 **Navigation Commands**:  
   `cd` - change directory  
   `ls` / `dir` - list files in the current directory  
   `pwd` - print working directory  

- **File Operations**:  
  `touch file.txt` - create a new file  
   `mkdir newFolder` - create a new directory  
   `rm file.txt` - remove a file  
   `mv old.txt new.txt` - rename/move a file  
 `cp file.txt copy.txt` - copy a file  

 **Aliases**:  
  Created a few sample aliases in the shell config - 
    `alias gs="git status"`  
     `alias ll="ls -la"`
