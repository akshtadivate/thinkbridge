# Git Practice

This file contains the Git basics I practiced: initializing a repo, adding files, committing changes, checking logs, and pushing to GitHub.

## Commands

- git init - Creates a new Git repository in the current folder.

- git status -Shows which files are staged, unstaged, or untracked.

- git add index.html
- git add .
Stages changes so they are ready to be committed.

git add index.html - adds a specific file.

git add . - adds all changes.

- git commit -m "Add initial portfolio structure"
Saves the staged changes with a clear message.

- git log
Displays all commits with ID, author, date, and message.

- git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/portfolio-site.git

- git branch -M main
- git push -u origin main
Links the local repo to GitHub and uploads the commits.
