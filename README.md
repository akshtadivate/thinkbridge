# P1-Farm-Diary

I want an app where i can note down my fields and what crops i grow there. if i add coconut trees in one area, i should be able to also add bananas, papayas, or vegetables in the same space. the app should help me plan what work is needed for each crop, like watering, adding fertilizer, spraying medicine for pests, cleaning weeds in between rows, and harvesting. i want it to show me what work is due today, what is coming this week, and also allow me to tick things done. if i do something like spraying or watering, i want to quickly write how much i gave, maybe even add a photo, so i can check later. i should be able to see a simple calendar of my farming tasks and also a small guide that tells me the usual needs for common crops like coconut, banana, papaya, tomato. it should not be complicated — just a few buttons to add crops, see tasks, add notes, and get reminders. most important is it should be simple to use on phone, even offline, with tamil and english words so any farmer can use it easily.

Lets me put this as a simple story of a farmer’s day with this app:

imagine a farmer wakes up in the morning, opens the app on his phone, and the first thing he sees is “today’s work.” it shows simple things like “water the tomato patch,” “spray nutrients for banana plants,” “check for pests in the groundnut field,” or “clean weeds between rows.” he can finish a task and just tap “done.” if he did some extra work, like pruning branches or adding compost, he just adds it as a quick note, maybe even snaps a photo.

when he wants to plan, he opens “my fields” and adds what he has: one field has paddy, another corner has papaya, between trees he grows vegetables. when he adds a crop, the app already has basic information ready — how often to water, what nutrients are usually given, common pest issues, and when harvesting is expected. he doesn’t need to type everything, he just selects from the predefined crop list and edits if he wants.

there’s also a simple calendar, so he can look ahead and see what work is lined up this week or next month. if rain comes, he can note it down and maybe skip watering. all these notes build a logbook he can check later, like how much fertilizer was used last season or how many kilos were harvested last year.

the app itself is not tied to one crop — it works for anything: trees, vegetables, grains, fruits, flowers. the built-in crop library just makes life easier by giving quick reference on spacing, watering, nutrients, and care for common crops. but he can also add his own custom crop if it’s not listed.

overall, the app feels like a simple diary and reminder system for farming, with the brain of a farming guide inside it. it’s not too complicated, just guiding the farmer every day with the right tasks and helping him remember what he did, so nothing is missed and the farm work becomes smoother.
